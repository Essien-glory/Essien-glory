           Hello and welcome to my profile!

          I'm Essien Glory, a Junior Data Analyst.

Currently engaged in hands-on practice and project development.

I am actively seeking internship and entry-level opportunities to further apply, expand my knowledge, and skills in data analysis.  

Excited about the prospect of contributing to the field of data analysis, I am dedicated to continuous learning and growth in this dynamic domain.
